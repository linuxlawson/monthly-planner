Monthly Planner for Chores/Duties

This is my first attempt using classes in python.  
It confused me and I'm not sure I got it right but the program works as it should.

It's basically a copy of the recipe program with different wording.  

About:  
This is a monthly planner concerning chores/duties for you and/or your kids (if you have),  
with fields to be filled in for: daily, weekly, and monthly chores/duties.  
Also, fields for name and month, and a text box for any additional notes.  

For those of you who have kids, the idea is simple.  
Fill in some of the fields, save to a text file, print the text file,  
and post it on their bedroom door, they will love you for it. :)  

Note: Default extension is .txt so no need to add one.
