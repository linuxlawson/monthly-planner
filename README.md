## Monthly Planner


A monthly planner that can be filled out and used to plan your month.  
Entry fields include: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly chores and/or duties.  
Also, a text box for any additional notes.  

For those of you who have kids, the idea is simple.  
1. Fill in *some* of the fields  
2. Save to a text file 
3. Print the text file
4. Post it on their bedroom door. They will love you for it. :)  

Of course, you can use it for yourself too, to help keep track of what needs to be done.

Important: Default extension is .txt so no need to add one.  

Note:  
If using Windows, you will need to use Pyinstaller (or similiar) to make executable.
