**Monthly Planner for Chores/Duties**

This is my first attempt using classes in python.  
It confused me and I'm not sure I got it right but the program works as it should.

It's basically a copy of the recipe program with different wording.  

**About:**  
This is a monthly planner concerning chores/duties for you and/or your kids (if you have),  
with entry fields to be filled in for: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly chores/duties.  
Also,  entry fields for name and month, and a text box for any additional notes.  

For those of you who have kids, the idea is simple.  
1. Fill in some of the fields  
2. Save to a text file 
3. Print the text file
4. Post it on their bedroom door. They will love you for it. :)  

Of course, you can use it for yourself too, to help keep track of what needs to be done.  

Note: Default extension is .txt so no need to add one.
